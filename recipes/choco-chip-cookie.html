    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic cookie originated in the United States in 1938 by American chef Ruth Graves Wakefield. The original did not have chocolate chips, but instead contained chopped up bits of a semi-sweet chocolate bar. Wakefield later went on to sell the recipe to Toll House, granting her a lifetime supply of chocolate. Over the years, there have been many variations of this famous cookie. Recipes that include additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal and even vegan versions! However, the recipe below is a my go-to recipe whenever I crave this tasty cookie. </p>
