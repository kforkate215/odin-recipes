<p>description of gumbo</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>For the Roux:</h3>
    <li>2 1/2 oz (74g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (130 ml) + 1 tbsp. grapeseed oil or high smoke point oil</li>

    <h3>For the Gumbo</h3>
    <li>1 lb. andouille sausage, cut into coins</li>
    <li>1 lb. chicken thighs</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 celery ribs, diced</li>
    <li>1 small green bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>1 jalapeño, seeded and diced</li>
    <li>1 cup (250 ml) amber-style beer</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 tsp. thyme</li>
    <li>4 bay leaves</li>
    <li>salt, to taste</li>
    <li>1 tsp. black pepper, plus more to taste</li>

    <h3>To Serve:</h3>
    <li>cooked white rice, for serving</li>
    <li>scallions, for serving</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Season chicken with salt, black pepper, and 1 tbsp. of grapeseed oil. Broil it until slightly charred and golden, about 8 minutes on each side, and set aside.</li>
    <p><strong>NOTE: Make sure that all the veggies are prepped, beer and stock are nearby, and you do not walk away from the roux.</strong></p>
    <li>Heat a thick bottomed 4-quart Dutch oven over medium. Add remaining oil and wait until it starts to smoke. Add in flour, using a whisk, stir constantly. Roux is ready when it has turned dark brown (the color of a Hershey's chocolate is about right), about 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the celery, japaleño, bell pepper, and onion for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and bay leaves for 1 minute. Once the onions turn transluscent, add the beer to deglaze, then add the stock, thyme, and 1 tsp. of black pepper.</li>
    <li>Stir slowly until the gumbo is at a simmer, then add the chicken and sausage. Bring back to a simmer and cover, stirring occasionally for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Gumbo should be thick, but not like gravy.</li>
    <li>Serve over cooked white rice, topped with scallions, and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
